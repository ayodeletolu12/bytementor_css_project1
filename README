This project requires code review.

At first the project was developed to have separate pages instead of a single page website. 

it was further reveiwed to use a single page design pattern so everything will be on the same page instead of having separate pages.

I use HTML ID in achieving the page scrolling in such a way that on clicking about in the Nav bar it will scroll down to the about section of the web page and on-clicking contact it will take me to contact section all in a single page.

The responsiveness of the web page was not put into consideration at this time.

This is basically HTML and CSS.
